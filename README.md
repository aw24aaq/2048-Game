# 2048- Game
## How to play 2048

- The game is played on a 4x4 grid filled with numbered tiles. Your goal is to combine these tiles to create a tile with the number 2048

## How it works

 - Use the arrow keys on your keyboard (up, down, left, right) to move the tiles.
 - Tiles with the same number that collide while moving will merge into one tile with the sum of their values. (e.g. 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8)
 - After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 will appear in a random empty spot on the board.
 - The game ends when there are no more empty spots on the board and no further merges are possible. You win if you create a 2048 tile, otherwise you lose.
